# Loan prediction Regression Baseline Model ‚Äì Numerical Features Only
This project demonstrates the process of building a **baseline classification model** using **Logistic Regression**, focused exclusively on **numerical features**. It walks through essential steps of **data preprocessing**, **model building**, and **performance evaluation**, offering a strong foundation for solving real-world classification problems using Python and machine learning.

## üìå Project Overview
The goal is to create a baseline model using **Logistic Regression** and evaluate its performance using **numerical features only**. Participants will:
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Scale features for model compatibility.
- Build a classification model.
- Evaluate it using various performance metrics and visualization techniques.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn to:

###  Load and Prepare a Dataset
- Import necessary Python libraries.
- Load a dataset and explore its structure.
- Identify numerical features relevant for classification.

### Preprocess Numerical Features
- Handle missing values using **median imputation**.
- Detect and remove outliers using **IQR** method.
- Scale features using **StandardScaler** for uniformity.

### Build a Logistic Regression Model
- Split the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.
- Train a **Logistic Regression** model using numerical features only.

### Evaluate Model Performance
- Predict on both training and testing sets.
- Compute evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - ROC-AUC
- Visualize ROC Curve for performance interpretation.

### Compile and Present Results
- Create a **summary table** with all performance metrics for easy interpretation.

## üìä Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python** üêç
- **Pandas** for data handling
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** for model building and evaluation
